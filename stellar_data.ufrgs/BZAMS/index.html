****************************************************************************

        "Stellar Interiors," 2nd ed., by Hansen, Kawaler, &amp; Trimble
****************************************************************************
This directory contains three versions of a FORTRAN code to make zero-age
main sequence models. The versions differ only in what equations of state and
opacities are used. These versions are called BZAMS1, BZAMS2, and BZAMS3,
and each may be found in the correspondingly named sub-directory. The three
versions differ as follows:
        BZAMS1: uses the Stellingwerf fit to Cox-Stewart opacities and the
                Dean Pesnell equation of state (no electron degeneracy).
                These are the same routines used in the code ZAMS found
                in the ZamsPuls directory. Unlike that code, however, BZAMS1
                does a much better job of constructing an atmosphere to
                start off integrations. (The same is true for the other
                BZAMS versions.)
        BZAMS2: uses a Icko Iben fit to Cox-Stewart opacities and a routine
                by Faulkner and Eggleton to compute the equation of state. It
                includes degenerate statistics for electrons.
        BZAMS2: uses the Pesnell equation of state but reads in, and
                interpolates, tabulated Cox-Stewart opacities.
Each version of the code is self-contained as a FORTRAN file but we also
include individual routines in each sub-directory (for those who want to play
around and perhaps use make files). We also include Windows PC executable files
for each version.

Note: We have retained the .for suffix on the FORTRAN files. Those using UNIX
based systems will probably have to change this to  .f .

        To use the codes, do the following.

From within the sub-directory, have a look at the file "bzams.par."
This file is the control file for the BZAMS code.  Adjust things like
the stellar mass, initial composition, and guesses for the starting
parameters.  A series of lines below the main control lines is not read
by the code, but has output summaries for a few models to use as you
wish and to provide guesses.  The columns should be self-evident.  The file
bzams.par must retain that name  because it is read in by bzams (in any of the
versions).

        Run bzams by simply typing "bzams1" (or 2 or 3) At the end of the run,
a few files will be output: a- bzams.sum, a one-line summary of the  model;
b-  bzams.out, a detailed listing of the model; c- bzams.puls, the model in a
format to be read by PULS.

        If you are lucky, bzams will converge on a model, and write out files
for use in PULS.  It will also write out a file called 'first.mod' to
use as a starting model for an evolution code (which is still being developed).

GOOD LUCK!
