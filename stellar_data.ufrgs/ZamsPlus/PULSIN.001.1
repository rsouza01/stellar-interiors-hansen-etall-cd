This file shows what your screen would look like if you invoked PULS
and gave it some input for a 1 solar mass model. It is assumed here
that PULS.001 has been created by ZAMS (and that file is also on
this CD-ROM).  Input is in lower case as answers to questions that
PULS asks. Remarks made between /* and */ are comments by us to
guide you.
_______________________________________________________________

YOUR INPUT FILE NAME IS
puls.001   /* This is a file generated by ZAMS which contains
		 Brunt-Vaisala frequencies, etc. You must ask
                 ZAMS to output this file. */
YOUR OUTPUT FILENAME IS
pulsout.001 /* This file will eventually contain the output
		 from PULS. */
PRINT OUT EIGENFUNCTIONS (Y/N)?
y           /* If you answer y or Y ("yes") to this question then
		 the program will write the eigenfunctions to your
		 output file for all subsequent cases. An n or N
		 means you don't want this to happen. */
ENTER L
100         /* This is the desired value of the angular momentum
		 quantum number. It remains fixed for the remainder
		 of the run. If you input 0 you get the radial case.
                 A positive non-zero value means you want to
                 analyze for nonradial motions. */
/* Additional output will be written to the screen at this point
    giving information on the model to be analyzed. In this
    case it will tell you that the mass is 1 Msun and the composition
    is X=0.74 and Y=0.24. */
ENTER GUESSED PERIOD (IN SECONDS)
(ENTER A PERIOD OF 0 TO STOP)
254.        /* This is the initial guess for the period of a
                 converged mode. The code then iterates to a
                 solution. If you enter 0 at this point the
                 whole calculation ends.*/
/* Material will now be written to the screen summarizing the
    progress of the iterations. You should not need this unless
    the solution does not converge. If it doesn't, then you
    have to start over again. When converged you will see--- */
FINAL VALUES: PERIOD = 2.53815E+2 EIG= 6.128E-4
10 NODES IN Y1   10 NODES in Y2
     PHASE DIAGRAM MODE -10
	      /* The first line gives the final converged period
                   in seconds and the converged value of the
                   eigenvalue (the square of 2 Pi/period). The node
                   counts give the total number of nodes in the
                   radial eigenfunction (Y1) and the total for the
                   transverse eigenfunction (Y2). The "-10" means
		   that you have found a p10 mode (see the discussion
                   in Appendix C.2). PULS is now ready for another
                   mode calculation. */
ENTER GUESSED PERIOD (IN SECONDS)
(ENTER A PERIOD OF 0 TO STOP)
0      /* This signals the end of the calculation. If you want
	    PULS to continue, enter another non-zero guess for
	    a period. */
/* Good luck, CJH, SDK & VT. */
