    <title>Stellar Evolution Tutorial (Demo Version)</title>
    <ul> 
      <li> <h3><font color=beffff>Introduction</font></h3> </li>
      <ul>
        <li> The following pages are a first attempt at explaining stellar 
evolution in a phenomenological, rather than quantitative, way. The aim is to 
give you an informed overview of the physics of the various stages, the 
things that occur, and importantly, the nucleosynthesis which occurs. The 
graphs are from recent calculations (details given below) and are not 
schematic (unless explicitly stated). But don't worry about the numbers. 
Its the overall behaviour that is important.</li><p>

	<li> Obviously these pages cannot teach you all the maths and 
physics you need to understand the evolution! It is assumed that you have 
enough background in that already. These pages are perhaps best used as an 
adjunct to a normal course in stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis. </li><p>

        <li> My own interest is in explaining the complex behaviour of AGB 
stars to non-experts. But the rest of the tutorial, from the ZAMS to the AGB, 
is a required background and is suitable for courses which do not go as far 
as the AGB evolution, or are not interested in the nucleosynthesis.</li><p>

        <li> I am seeking comments on how to improve these presentations, so 
please feel free to <a href="mailto:john.lattanzio@sci.monash.edu.au"> email me </a>
 with comments and criticisms. Any suggestions for clarification, in text 
of graphs, would be welcome.</li><p>

        <li> A note on time.... The movies show time-dependence, but its 
important to realise that this is not linear! In fact, the times were chosen 
to illustrate features of the evolution. The frames were picked so that the 
feature we were looking at was clearly seen, independent of the time. This 
means that sometimes the time between successive frames is dramatically 
different. In the movies with two frames next to each other, one of the 
frames usually indicates the time, so in those cases the rate of the movie 
is obvious. But beware that in other cases the times between frames may vary a 
lot!</li><p>

	<li> I tried to make the labels large, without taking up too much 
space in the graph. Some of the lines are too thick, I now realise. These 
will be fixed in the next <a href="information.html"> version.</a> </li><p>

	<li> Note that not all movies are included here, and neither is all text. This is a sample version of a product in development. For a complete and updated version please contact us at <a href="information.html"> Cantanout. </a></li><p>

        <li> Some of the movies show two frames at a time, such as the 
internal evolution and the corresponding position in the HR diagram. For 
these movies you have the choice of the two frames appearing either 
horizontally (graphs next to each other) or vertically (one above the other). 
Choose whichever fits your screen best.</li><p>

        <li> <font color=gold> Please note: no stars were harmed during the making of these
movies....</font></li><p>

      <ul>
         <li>  We will follow the evolution of two stars, from the 
main-sequence through to the thermally-pulsing AGB, which is essentially the 
end of their lives. We have chosen two masses: M=1 Msun and M=5 Msun; both 
have essentially a solar composition with X=0.6872,  Y=0.2928 and Z=0.02.
</li><p>
         <li>  The figure below shows the evolution of both stars and
identifies the Early-AGB and the Thermally-Pulsing AGB.<br>
